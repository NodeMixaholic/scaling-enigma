    <h2 id="why-roblox-is-evil-and-we-should-all-avoid-it-like-ninten-err-the-plague">Why
      Roblox is evil and we should all avoid it like Ninten... err... the
      plague.</h2>
    <p>Roblox is an online game development and playing software that is
      targeted at kids. But it seems like ROBLOX has some shady practices that
      are worth noting.</p>
    <p>Roblox &nbsp; Terms of Service&nbsp; (TOS) are exploitive and
      restrictive. Roblox claims the following:&nbsp; You hereby irrevocably
      transfer and assign to Us all right, title, and interest in and to your
      Content.&nbsp; They sound so generous on first glance, but there&nbsp;
      more on the terms of service page. Roblox claims the following:&nbsp; You
      hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free,
      fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense through
      unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use any or all of Your Content for
      any [reason]&nbsp; Roblox is a company that is dedicated to exploiting its
      developers and making money off of them, and in order to do so it needs
      people to buy their useless in-game currency.</p>
    <p>The ROBLOX Studio software, which is what you develop games in, is
      terrible and buggy. It crashes every few minutes to few hours and has a
      bunch of really bad bugs that even the developers can't fix. This has led
      many to find other software tools, such as Unity 3D or Unreal Engine 4.</p>
    <p>If you're thinking about buying robux, remember that it&nbsp; just an
      exploit for the company to make more money. ROBUX always go back to the
      company&nbsp; pockets. Even if you try to create a place. Even if they
      claim you can make big money for creating a place, you most likely can
      not, because it&nbsp; an uphill battle that is rare to win. Let&nbsp; just
      say the rich get richer and the poor get poorer because if you want to
      make your place popular you have to either get youtubers to endorse it
      (which requires you to pay the youtubers) or go through the lottery that
      is ROBLOX&nbsp; AD system (which requires you to pay ROBLOX in robux.)
      Also: ROBLOX takes a total 75% cut of worth of ROBUX via their sketchy
      developer payout program, and you need 1000 dollars of ROBUX to even start
      getting paid. This is compared to Steam&nbsp; 30% and Epic&nbsp; 15%.</p>
    <p>The ROBLOX community is also criticized for being toxic, with many users
      being rude or just straight up abusive to others. This breaks Roblox&nbsp;
      policies against abuse and bullying, but the company has taken very little
      action against these users so far.</p>
    <p>Also worth noting: when Epic Games were suing Apple, ROBLOX re-checked
      the Apple EULA and they found out that external game stores were not
      allowed on the App Store, so ROBLOX changed their&nbsp; games&nbsp;
      to&nbsp; experiences , but we all know they are games. Very shady indeed.</p>
    <p>ROBLOX has been the subject of much criticism for it&nbsp; exploitative
      and shady practices, poor quality software, and toxic community.</p>
    <h2 id="in-addition">In addition:</h2>
    <p>ROBLOX keeps, purposefully or not, breaking compatibility with Linux.
      Once in 2012, and once in early August 2021. The two crashes don't seem
      coincidental, because they are so close together of when people found a
      way to run ROBLOX on Linux, and they are similar crashes. In fact, it
      seems like its on purpose because of this.</p>
